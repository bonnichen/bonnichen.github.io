          Hi, I'm Bonnie, a sophomore at Cornell University majoring in computer
          science. I am passionate about creating impactful and accessible
          solutions to real-world problems. I enjoy exploring
          how technology can be used to create efficient, secure, and
          user-centered systems that help make a positive difference in everyday
          life.
